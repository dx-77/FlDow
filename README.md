# FlDow
FlDow is designed to download actual verisons of frequently* used Windows programs
Programs are downloaded to the FlDow working directory in the folder "Tools".
If the downloaded program is already exists in the "Tools" folder and it was downloaded more than
3 (in version 0.5.1) hours ago, the program is overwritten.
